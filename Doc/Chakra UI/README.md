<Box m={2} bg="green" color="#f00">Hello World</Box>
```
- `m`: Margin
- `bg`: Background color
- `color`: Text color

Chakra UI offers a collection of customizable icons via the `@chakra-ui/icons` package, which can be used seamlessly in your application.

### 3. **Form Controls**
Chakra UI provides built-in form components like `Textarea`, `Input`, and `Checkbox` with advanced form controls (e.g., `isDisabled`, `isInvalid`) for easy form validation and handling.
